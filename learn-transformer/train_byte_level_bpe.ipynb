I\\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\\nI\\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn\\'t fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.',\n",

       "  'Sysco Corp. has terminated its planned $3.5 billion takeover of US Foods, it announced Monday, after a federal judge blocked the combination. The company is opting instead to add $3 billion to its stock-buyback program.\\nWith the deal breaking up, Sysco will pay a $300 million termination fee to US Foods and a $12.5 million fee to Performance Food Group, which had agreed to buy some US Foods facilities. Sysco, based in Houston, plans to make the share repurchases over the next two years.\\nRosemont, Illinois-based US Foods operates a major distribution center in Fishers. Sysco has a large warehouse at 4000 W. 62nd St., in Indianapolis.\\nSysco had fought for more than a year to gain government approval for the transaction, which antitrust regulators said would hurt competition and lead to higher prices. Sysco and US Foods dominate a market known as broadline foodservice, which supplies school cafeterias, restaurants and hotels. Sysco had argued that the acquisition would bring $1 billion in savings, letting it offer lower prices to customers.\\nInvestors have responded with relief to the deal’s demise, reflecting concerns about the company undertaking an ambitious merger. Sysco shares rose 3.1 percent the day the transaction was halted by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, and the stock climbed again Monday morning after the merger was withdrawn.\\nMehta blocked the merger on June 23 when he granted a Federal Trade Commission request to delay the transaction. The FTC had sued the companies in February, saying the deal would give Sysco an oversized share of an industry where it’s already the biggest player.\\nIn arguments before Mehta in May, the two sides clashed over the scope of the market in which the companies compete. Sysco and US Foods argued that the commission was relying on a “tortured” analysis, ignoring the variety of distribution channels available to customers.\\nSysco said on Monday that it weighed embarking on an appeal but decided against it.\\nShares of Sysco rose as much as 1.6 percent to $39 in early trading. The stock had slid 3.3 percent this year through the end of last week.'],\n",

If the score is below the maximum threshold, no further action is needed; however, if the score is above the maximum but less than twice the maximum, the user is advised to wear protective eyewear when handling hazardous materials. Finally, if the score is greater than twice the maximum, the user is urged to seek immediate medical attention as their eyes may be seriously injured.', 'Build a Bash module snippet that Checks Extreme Sneezing and coughing etiquette: Proper Disposal of Tissues for Engineer for Beginners.

If the input cannot be parsed, then the exception will be caught by the `catch` block and handled gracefully by displaying an error message. The main function prompts the user to enter two numbers, which are passed to the `Add()` function through its parameters `x` and `y`. Then, the result of the addition operation is printed to the console.', 'Write a Ruby code snippet to Calculate Low Finance: Loan Calculations for Engineer for Experts. Consider the Safety and implement appropriate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Dry-run, then provide comments explaining your decision-making process and how the control flow is structured. Here is some sample ruby code which implements loan calculations based off of user inputted values. It includes proper error handling through `if`/`elsif` conditionals as well as dry running by utilizing a hash table to store all possible inputs and their corresponding outputs. The output also contains explanatory comments regarding each step taken during calculation. \\n\\n```ruby \\n# Define constants for interest rates\\r\\nAPR = 0.05 # Annual Percentage Rate (float)\\r\\n\\r\\ndef calculate_low_finance(principal:, term_in_years:, monthly_interest_rate:)\\r\\n  raise ArgumentError, \"Monthly Interest Rate must be greater than zero\" unless monthly_interest_rate > 0\\r\\n\\r\\n  # Convert months into years for easier math later on\\r\\n  term_in_months = term_in_years * 12\\r\\n  \\r\\n  # Calculate simple interest formula \\r\\n  simple_interest = principal * monthly_interest_rate * term_in_months / 12.0\\r\\n\\r\\n  # Calculate compound interest formula using continuously compounded rate\\r\\n  cc_monthly_interest_rate = (1 + APR / 12.0).pow(-12) - 1\\r\\n  compound_interest = principal * cc_monthly_interest_rate ** term_in_months\\r\\n\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    principal: principal, \\r\\n    term_in_years: term_in_years, \\r\\n    monthly_interest_rate: monthly_interest_rate, \\r\\n    apr: APR, \\r\\n    simple_interest: simple_interest, \\r\\n    compound_interest: compound_interest, \\r\\n    total_interest: compound_interest - simple_interest\\r\\n  }\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ninputs = {\\r\\n  principal: 10000.0, # Principal amount (float)\\r\\n  term_in_years: 3.0, # Term in years (float)\\r\\n  monthly_interest_rate: 0.04 # Monthly Interest Rate (float)\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nresults = {} # Initialize empty results hash\\r\\n\\r\\n# Loop over all possible inputs and run calculations\\r\\ninputs.each do |key, value|\\r\\n  results[key] = calculate_low_finance(**{ key => value }) \\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\n# Print out calculated results along with explanatory notes\\r\\nputs \"\\\\nLoan Calculations for #{inputs[:term_in_years].round(1)} Years at #{inputs[:monthly_interest_rate]}% Interest\\\\n\"\\r\\nputs \"Principal: $#{inputs[:principal]}\"\\r\\nputs \"Term: #{inputs[:term_in_years]} Years\"\\r\\nputs \"Monthly Interest Rate: #{inputs[:monthly_interest_rate]}%\"\\r\\nputs \"Annual Percentage Rate: #{inputs[:apr]*100}% (based on monthy rate)\"\\r\\nputs \"\"\\r\\nputs \"| Equation               | Result                    | Comment                                                                                         |\"\\r\\nputs \"|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\"\\'\\r\\nputs \"| Simple Interest        | $#{results[:simple_interest].round(2)}      | Paid every month                                                                                |\"\\r\\nputs \"| Compound Interest      | $#{results[:compound_interest].round(2)}    | Accrued daily from start date until end date                                                    |\"\\r\\nputs \"| Total Interest         | $#{results[:total_interest].round(2)}       | Sum of simple and compound interest                                                            |\"\\r\\nputs \"\"\\r\\n```']}\n"

Were temples built for all of the children of Cronus, or were they only built for the major ones? If some were left out, is there any indication of why? According to the traditional geneaology of the Greek Gods, Cronus had six children with Rhea: Hestia, Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades and Demeter. All children were part of at least one major variation of the Twelve Olympians and - with the exception of Hestia - had temples honouring them. \\n\\nHestia was Cronus firstborn and her sanctuary was the hearth of the Prytaneion, the political and religious center of the community. Also, Hestia was thought of as being present in every offering fire in all temples and received first offering in sacrifices. Thus, she didn't need temples of her own.\\n\\nOf course there may have been temples honouring Hestia that we simply don't know about. After all, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\"}\n"
