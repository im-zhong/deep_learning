how to use hugging face peft to fine tune llama 8b, using alpaca dataset

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on how to fine-tune LLaMA 8B using Hugging Face‚Äôs PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library with the Alpaca dataset.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Step 1: Environment Setup

Make sure you have:
	‚Ä¢	At least one A100 80GB GPU (8B is huge, even with PEFT).
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.10+
	‚Ä¢	The following packages:

pip install transformers datasets peft accelerate bitsandbytes trl

Optionally:

pip install wandb  # For logging


‚∏ª

üóÇÔ∏è Step 2: Prepare the Dataset (Alpaca)

The Alpaca dataset is instruction-following format.

You can load it directly:

from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("tatsu-lab/alpaca")

Alpaca sample structure:

{
  "instruction": "Write a short story about a robot.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a robot named..."
}

You‚Äôll need to convert this to a single text prompt.

‚∏ª

‚ú® Step 3: Prompt Formatting

Example template:

def format_prompt(example):
    if example['input']:
        return f"### Instruction:\n{example['instruction']}\n\n### Input:\n{example['input']}\n\n### Response:\n{example['output']}"
    else:
        return f"### Instruction:\n{example['instruction']}\n\n### Response:\n{example['output']}"

Apply it to the dataset:

dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: {"text": format_prompt(x)})


‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Load the Base Model (LLaMA 8B with Quantization)

You need the correct weights. Example using 4-bit quantization to save memory:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype="float16",
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "huggingface/llama-8b",  # Replace with your model repo or local path
    quantization_config=bnb_config,
    device_map="auto"
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("huggingface/llama-8b", use_fast=False)
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Very important for causal LM


‚∏ª

ü™ù Step 5: Apply PEFT (LoRA)

from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType

peft_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    inference_mode=False,
    r=8,  # Rank
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # For LLaMA, these are common
)

model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()


‚∏ª

üèÉ Step 6: Set up Training (Using transformers Trainer)

from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=16,
    warmup_steps=100,
    max_steps=3000,
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    fp16=True,
    logging_steps=10,
    output_dir="./lora-llama-8b-alpaca",
    save_strategy="steps",
    save_steps=500,
    report_to="none",  # Or "wandb" if logging
)

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=False,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)


‚∏ª

üöÄ Step 7: Start Fine-tuning

trainer.train()


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 8: Save the LoRA Adapters

model.save_pretrained("./lora-llama-8b-alpaca")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./lora-llama-8b-alpaca")


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Quick Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Gradient checkpointing can further reduce memory usage.
	‚Ä¢	Adjust r, lora_alpha, and target_modules for better performance/memory trade-offs.
	‚Ä¢	You can use QLoRA (4-bit) with PEFT for very memory-efficient fine-tuning.
	‚Ä¢	Consider using trl‚Äôs SFTTrainer for more sophisticated fine-tuning.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can help you write a complete runnable script. Let me know!

should I mask out the token before Response in the training example?

Great question!
No, you should not mask out the tokens before Response in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with instruction datasets like Alpaca.

Here‚Äôs why:

During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), the model is typically trained to predict all tokens, including the instruction and the response.
This is the default in most open fine-tuning implementations like Alpaca-LoRA, Vicuna, etc.

However, you could mask out the instruction part (or just not compute the loss on it) in more refined setups, especially if:
	‚Ä¢	You want the model to focus only on generating the response.
	‚Ä¢	You want to align better with causal generation behavior during inference.

But most people don‚Äôt mask it because:
	‚Ä¢	It simplifies training.
	‚Ä¢	The model still learns from the instruction format.
	‚Ä¢	Most widely shared Alpaca-style fine-tuning scripts don‚Äôt mask.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Best Practices:

Scenario	Mask?	Reason
Supervised Fine-tuning (like Alpaca-LoRA)	‚ùå No	Predict all tokens, common in community setups
SFT with loss masking (advanced)	‚úÖ Optional	Model focuses on response tokens only
Reinforcement Learning (like PPO in RLHF)	‚úÖ Yes	Rewards are usually computed on the response part only


‚∏ª

üîç If you want to mask out the instruction (advanced):

You can pass labels to the trainer like this:

def tokenize_with_mask(example):
    prompt = format_prompt(example)
    tokenized = tokenizer(prompt, truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=512)
    labels = tokenized.input_ids.copy()

    # Find the start index of the response
    response_start = prompt.find("### Response:") + len("### Response:")
    response_token_start = len(tokenizer(prompt[:response_start]).input_ids)

    # Mask out instruction tokens
    labels[:response_token_start] = [-100] * response_token_start  # -100 means ignore in loss

    tokenized["labels"] = labels
    return tokenized

But again, this is optional and not required for typical Alpaca-LoRA fine-tuning.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ TL;DR:
	‚Ä¢	For Alpaca-style SFT ‚Üí Don‚Äôt mask.
	‚Ä¢	For more precise control ‚Üí You can mask the instruction.
	‚Ä¢	If you want to follow Vicuna, Alpaca, or most open LLaMA fine-tuning ‚Üí They do not mask.

If you want, I can help you modify your training script to include masking!

explain this code: tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Very important for causal LM


Great question! This line:

tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Very important for causal LM

is very common and very important when fine-tuning LLaMA or similar causal language models.
Let me break it down step by step.

‚∏ª

üìö Background

Causal Language Model (CLM)
	‚Ä¢	Causal LM predicts the next token based on previous tokens.
	‚Ä¢	It can‚Äôt see future tokens (unlike BERT-style MLMs).
	‚Ä¢	The loss is calculated over the whole sequence (except tokens we mask with -100).

‚∏ª

üõë Problem:

LLaMA and many open models:
	‚Ä¢	Do not have a default pad token.
	‚Ä¢	They were trained with the End-of-Sequence (eos_token) as their only special token.

If you pass sequences with padding but without defining a proper pad_token, two things can go wrong:
	1.	The model will raise an error because it doesn‚Äôt know what to do with pad_token_id.
	2.	If you use a random pad token, the model might accidentally learn to predict padding tokens.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Solution:

By setting:

tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

you are telling the tokenizer:
	‚Ä¢	Use the End-of-Sequence token (which the model knows) as padding.
	‚Ä¢	When the model sees padding, it will naturally treat it as sequence end.

This works because:
	‚Ä¢	The model already knows to stop predicting after the EOS token.
	‚Ä¢	During training, you typically mask out the padding token in the loss (so it doesn‚Äôt try to predict it).

‚∏ª

üî• Why it‚Äôs ‚ÄúVery Important‚Äù:
	‚Ä¢	Without this line, your training will probably crash or give bad results because the model won‚Äôt know how to handle padding.
	‚Ä¢	It ensures the model can process batches with different sequence lengths safely.
	‚Ä¢	It avoids accidental learning on pad tokens.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ In short:

What it does	Why it matters
Sets pad token to EOS	Ensures padding is valid for LLaMA
Prevents training errors	Causal LMs like LLaMA don‚Äôt have pad tokens by default
Keeps training stable	EOS is a natural stopping token


‚∏ª

üöÄ Bonus Tip:

If you use DataCollatorForLanguageModeling with mlm=False (causal LM setting), it will automatically ignore pad tokens when calculating loss.
So this setup is perfectly aligned.

If you want, I can explain how padding affects batching and GPU efficiency too! Just let me know!

Great question! This line:

tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Very important for causal LM

is very common and very important when fine-tuning LLaMA or similar causal language models.

Great question!
The mlm argument in DataCollatorForLanguageModeling is critical because it controls whether the collator prepares data for:
	‚Ä¢	Masked Language Modeling (MLM) ‚Üí for models like BERT
	‚Ä¢	Causal Language Modeling (CLM) ‚Üí for models like GPT, LLaMA

‚∏ª

üìö Detailed Explanation:

mlm argument:

DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=..., mlm=True/False)

Value of mlm	Meaning	Used for
mlm=True	Prepares masked language modeling tasks. Random tokens are masked and the model learns to predict them.	BERT-style models
mlm=False	Prepares causal language modeling tasks. The model learns to predict the next token without any masking.	GPT, LLaMA, causal LMs


‚∏ª

‚úÖ When mlm=True (For BERT)
	‚Ä¢	It randomly selects tokens in the sequence to be masked (e.g., replaces them with [MASK]).
	‚Ä¢	The model‚Äôs goal is to predict the masked tokens.

Example:

Input: "The cat [MASK] on the mat."
Target: "The cat sat on the mat."

This is what BERT was trained on.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ When mlm=False (For GPT / LLaMA)
	‚Ä¢	No tokens are masked.
	‚Ä¢	The model learns to predict the next token in the sequence.

Example:

Input: "The cat sat on the"
Target: "cat sat on the mat."

This is the correct setting for causal language modeling fine-tuning.

‚∏ª

üî• Why It‚Äôs Important for LLaMA:

When fine-tuning LLaMA (a causal LM), you must set mlm=False because:
	‚Ä¢	LLaMA is not trained to handle masked tokens.
	‚Ä¢	It only knows how to predict the next token in a left-to-right fashion.

Example:

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=False  # IMPORTANT for LLaMA and GPT models
)

If you incorrectly set mlm=True, the model will either:
	‚Ä¢	Try to predict masked tokens it was never trained to handle.
	‚Ä¢	Crash because it doesn‚Äôt have a [MASK] token.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ TL;DR:

Argument	For	Effect
mlm=True	BERT, MLM models	Randomly masks tokens
mlm=False	GPT, LLaMA, CLM models	No masking, learns next-token prediction

For your LLaMA + Alpaca fine-tuning, always set:

mlm = False

why in the training arguments, set the fp16 = true? If I use the 3090, could I set the bf16=true?

Excellent question!
Let‚Äôs break this down carefully:

‚∏ª

üîç Why fp16=True in TrainingArguments?

üîß What is fp16?

When you set:

fp16 = True

you are enabling mixed precision training using 16-bit floating point (half precision).

‚úÖ Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Less memory usage: Reduces memory consumption by roughly half compared to full precision (fp32).
	‚Ä¢	Faster training: Many GPUs (like A100, 3090) have Tensor Cores that accelerate fp16 computation.
	‚Ä¢	Enables larger batch sizes or bigger models to fit in GPU memory.

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Can You Use bf16=True on RTX 3090?

üîç What is bf16?

bf16 = bfloat16 (brain floating point 16-bit)
It‚Äôs more stable than fp16 because it has a larger exponent range (same as fp32), so it‚Äôs:
	‚Ä¢	Less likely to underflow/overflow.
	‚Ä¢	More numerically stable.

‚úÖ Hardware Support:

GPU	fp16 support	bf16 support
A100	‚úÖ Native, very fast	‚úÖ Native, very fast
RTX 3090	‚úÖ Native, very fast	‚ùå Not fully supported in Tensor Cores

üõë Important:
The RTX 30 series (Ampere) supports fp16 acceleration, but does not natively accelerate bf16.
It can emulate bf16 via slower fallback, but you won‚Äôt get speed benefits and sometimes it‚Äôs not even supported by the libraries.

On 3090:
	‚Ä¢	fp16=True ‚Üí ‚úÖ Supported and fast.
	‚Ä¢	bf16=True ‚Üí ‚ùå Likely not supported natively ‚Üí usually ignored or runs slower.

On A100 or H100:
	‚Ä¢	bf16=True ‚Üí ‚úÖ Best choice (more stable, no loss in speed).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary

Setting	RTX 3090	A100
fp16=True	‚úÖ Recommended	‚úÖ Supported
bf16=True	‚ùå Not supported	‚úÖ Recommended


‚∏ª

üî• TL;DR:
	‚Ä¢	On RTX 3090 ‚Üí Use fp16=True.
	‚Ä¢	On A100 ‚Üí Prefer bf16=True if available.

üí° If you try bf16=True on a 3090, you‚Äôll probably either get a warning and fallback to fp32, or it will just be ignored.

If you want, I can help you set up your TrainingArguments for the most efficient setup on your specific GPU!

I found on nvidia official website that 3090 do support bf16 like A100, cause they use the same arch under the neath, so could I set bf16=True

You‚Äôre absolutely right to dig into NVIDIA‚Äôs architecture details ‚Äî let‚Äôs carefully clarify this.

‚úÖ Fact Check: Does RTX 3090 Support bfloat16?

The Ampere architecture (which both RTX 3090 and A100 are based on) does technically support bfloat16 at the hardware level.

üîç From NVIDIA‚Äôs official Ampere whitepaper:
	‚Ä¢	The A100 fully supports bfloat16 with Tensor Core acceleration.
	‚Ä¢	The RTX 30 series (including 3090) does support bfloat16 arithmetic on Tensor Cores, but:
	‚Ä¢	Early CUDA / PyTorch support for bfloat16 on consumer GPUs was limited.
	‚Ä¢	As of PyTorch 1.12+, bf16 is supported on Ampere GPUs, including RTX 3090, but:
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs not as optimized as on A100.
	‚Ä¢	Speedup can be less significant compared to fp16 on consumer GPUs.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ So, can you set bf16=True on RTX 3090?

Yes, you can.

Starting from:
	‚Ä¢	torch >= 1.12
	‚Ä¢	transformers >= 4.20
	‚Ä¢	CUDA 11.0+

You can set:

bf16 = True

in TrainingArguments and it will work.

But:
	‚Ä¢	On consumer GPUs like the 3090, you might not see the same speed advantage as fp16.
	‚Ä¢	Some versions of libraries may fall back to fp32 precision if bf16 kernels are not fully available.

‚∏ª

üî• Practical Advice:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If you want maximum compatibility and proven acceleration ‚Üí use fp16=True.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If you want numerical stability and your environment supports it ‚Üí try bf16=True. Modern transformers and accelerate libraries support it properly.
	‚Ä¢	üöÄ If you use accelerate‚Äôs accelerate config, it will automatically set the correct precision based on your GPU.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Example Setup for RTX 3090:

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=16,
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    fp16=False,   # Turn off fp16
    bf16=True,    # Enable bf16
    logging_steps=10,
    max_steps=3000,
    output_dir="./lora-llama-8b-alpaca",
)

If you get warnings that bf16 isn‚Äôt fully supported in some kernels, you can safely switch back to fp16=True and still have excellent performance.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Key Takeaway:

Feature	RTX 3090	A100
fp16	Fully supported	Fully supported
bf16	Supported since PyTorch 1.12+	Fully supported
Tensor Core Speedup	Slightly faster with fp16	Optimized for bf16

If you want, I can help you write a precision-detection script to automatically choose the best setting for your GPU! Would you like that? üòä

In your code, I notice that you load the model in 4 bit quantification, and in training args you set fp16=True, does that settings conflict with each other?

Excellent catch! This is a really good question and something that often confuses people when doing low-bit fine-tuning.

Let‚Äôs go into detail carefully:

‚∏ª

üìö Does fp16=True Conflict with 4-bit Quantization?

‚úÖ Quick Answer:

No, it does not conflict.

But you need to understand what precision each part of the model uses:

‚∏ª

üí° What Happens with 4-bit Quantization + fp16=True?

When you load the model like this:

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype="float16",  # Computation is done in fp16 here
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
)

You are saying:
	‚Ä¢	Model weights are stored in 4-bit quantized format (very memory efficient).
	‚Ä¢	Computations (matrix multiplications, etc.) are performed in float16 or bfloat16.

‚∏ª

When you set:

TrainingArguments(fp16=True)

You are telling Hugging Face‚Äôs Trainer to:
	‚Ä¢	Use mixed precision training for things like:
	‚Ä¢	Gradients
	‚Ä¢	Optimizer states
	‚Ä¢	Data transfer between GPU and CPU

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Key Point:

Component	Precision
Model Weights	4-bit quantized
Computation Precision	fp16 (or bf16 if chosen)
Gradients	fp16 (controlled by TrainingArguments)
Optimizer States	fp16 (controlled by TrainingArguments)

So fp16=True does not conflict with loading the model in 4-bit.
They work together:
	‚Ä¢	4-bit quantization saves memory on the model side.
	‚Ä¢	fp16 training speeds up gradient computation and data flow.

‚∏ª

üî• What If You Use bf16=True Instead?

It would still work!
You could also use:

bnb_4bit_compute_dtype="bfloat16"

and:

TrainingArguments(bf16=True)

‚úÖ This is totally compatible.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary:

Feature	Role
4-bit Quantization	Compress model weights
bnb_4bit_compute_dtype	Set precision of forward/backward computation
fp16=True or bf16=True	Set precision of training steps (gradients, optimizer, etc.)

üëâ They target different parts of the training pipeline, so they can and should work together.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Best Practice:

When using Hugging Face + PEFT + 4-bit (QLoRA style):
	‚Ä¢	Always set bnb_4bit_compute_dtype to either float16 or bfloat16 (matching your training args).
	‚Ä¢	Set either fp16=True or bf16=True in TrainingArguments.

This is exactly what QLoRA paper and open-source implementations like lora-fine-tuning are doing.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can help you write a fully consistent setup for 4-bit quantization + bf16 or fp16 fine-tuning specifically for your GPU and Hugging Face Trainer! üòä Would you like that?

explain     bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",

Great question! These two settings are very important when using 4-bit quantization with Hugging Face‚Äôs bitsandbytes integration, especially in QLoRA-style fine-tuning.

Let‚Äôs break them down carefully:

‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£ bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True

üîç What it means:

This enables double quantization.

In simple terms:
	‚Ä¢	You first quantize the model weights to 4-bit.
	‚Ä¢	Then you quantize the quantization constants (the scales used to dequantize the weights) to reduce memory even further.

‚úÖ Why use it?
	‚Ä¢	Further memory savings.
	‚Ä¢	Reduces the storage cost of the quantization scales.
	‚Ä¢	Allows even bigger models to fit into memory.

üöÄ Key Point:
	‚Ä¢	Without double quantization:
Each block of weights needs its own scale factor (typically stored in 16 or 32-bit).
	‚Ä¢	With double quantization:
Even the scale factors get compressed.

üëâ This is a QLoRA trick to save extra VRAM without significant loss in performance.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"

üîç What it means:

This selects the quantization algorithm.

nf4 stands for NormalFloat4, which is a special 4-bit floating-point format introduced in the QLoRA paper.

Quant Type	Description
fp4	Regular 4-bit floating point, less accurate
nf4	NormalFloat4, better approximation of real weight distributions

‚úÖ Why use nf4?
	‚Ä¢	It has higher quantization precision than other 4-bit methods.
	‚Ä¢	nf4 is specifically designed to minimize information loss when quantizing large language models.
	‚Ä¢	This is the recommended setting in most state-of-the-art fine-tuning setups (including the original QLoRA).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary Table

Setting	Purpose	Effect
bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True	Compress quantization constants	More VRAM savings, negligible performance drop
bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"	Select quantization format	Best accuracy for 4-bit quantization


‚∏ª

üî• TL;DR:

You should almost always use both of these settings together when doing 4-bit fine-tuning (QLoRA style) because:
	‚Ä¢	nf4 gives the best precision in 4-bit quantization.
	‚Ä¢	double_quant=True gives you extra memory savings for free.
